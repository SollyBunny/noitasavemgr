# Noita Save Manager

This is really just a general save manager for games, but I made it for Noita.

## Usage

1. Install python
2. Run `python savemgr.py`

## Config

Config can be found in `config.py`

By default supports:
* Noita on Windows and on Linux (via WINE or Steam Proton)
* Noita Entangled if installed in `~/Games/NoitaEntangled`
